                <h1>We are a Chicago-based dance company that values making intelligent, visually rich dance theater driven by inquiry. We ground our inquiry in contemporary issues and the history of art and ideas, toward our pursuit of bold, exacting and potent physicality.</h1>

                <p>The Seldoms is in its seventeeth year. Under Carrie Hanson’s direction, the company is committed to bringing audiences an expanded experience of dance that ignites thought around real-world issues. With dance at the center, the company’s vision extends to a total action and environment and includes collaboration with practitioners in fields including theater, architecture, installation, video, sound, and fashion.With full-length works on pressing issues such as the 2008 recession, climate change, and most recently a trilogy about power in America,  The Seldoms has built a reputation for “well-crafted and researched works that don’t hold forth a political agenda, but look instead at how these towering issues reflect back on our own humanity” (New City, which named The Seldoms Best Local Dance Company in 2012).</p>
                
                <p>Their acclaimed dance theater work, Power Goes (2015) was commissioned by the Museum of Contemporary Art, awarded a National Performance Network Creation Fund and a prestigious National Dance Project Production Grant, and has toured to nine US cities. Stupormarket, which examined the 2008 economic crisis, was named “Best of 2011” by the Chicago Tribune, Chicago Reader, and TimeOut Chicago. In 2015, The Seldoms were the first resident artist at the National Center for Choreography at the University of Akron.</p>

                <p>Nationally recognized collaborators include composer/sound designers Richard Woodbury and Mikhail Fiksel, playwright Stuart Flack, visual artists Bob Faust, Fraser Taylor, Faheem Majeed, and Jackie Kazarian, musicians Timothy Daisy and Chihsuan Yang, and fashion designers Anke Loh and Maria Pinto. Chicago venues such as the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago, the Harris Theater for Music and Dance, The Dance Center of Columbia College have presented the group, which has also performed across the US. The Seldoms is also well known for multi-disciplinary works in unconventional sites, such as a truck garage, an Olympic-sized outdoor pool, and in 2017, the historic Pulaski Park fieldhouse.</p>
                <p>The Seldoms has developed international connections in Russia, Taiwan, and most recently Scotland, where they undertook an exchange with Glasgow visual artists to develop Toolbox, a resource for dancemakers.</p>
                <p>The Seldoms is comprised of artists and educators who introduce the work and dance/performance in inventive, focused ways to connect with audiences, students and communities. We conduct an annual summer intensive, open our company classes to community, and appear at forums for arts, education and the humanities throughout Chicago such as the Loyola University Museum of Art (LUMA) and the Chicago Humanities Festival.</p>
                <p class="btmspace-50">The Seldoms is in residency at Pulaski Park, through the Chicago Park District’s Arts Partners in Residence Program, which unites artists and communities in Chicago’s parks. The company provides free high-quality movement instruction to neighborhood youth ages 3-13.</p>
